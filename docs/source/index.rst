Welcome to OpenPassPhrase!
==========================

OpenPassPhrase is an open source password manager project. It is primarily
targeted at knowledgeable users with access to their own private server
(virtual or dedicated). Future support for PaaS implementation is also planned.

The main objective of this project is to provide a secure backend API for
aggregating arbitrary secret data entries (e.g. account numbers, usernames
and passwords) in a tabular format. The backend service can then be deployed
on a user's private server instance and accessed from anywhere.

The API is RESTful in nature and supports standard CRUD operations as well
as additional capabilities such as authentication and secure passphrase
generation.
